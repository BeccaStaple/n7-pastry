                N7 Pastry is the realisation of a long held dream for Crouch End based Gemma
                Staple, who has wanted to own her own cake and dessert business since the age of
                12 ! Gemma's broad baking experience, stretching back over a decade, began in the
                pastry kitchen of a four star hotel in Somerset, when she was just 16. This was
                followed by spells as pastry chef for a high end event catering company, a Michelin
                star restaurant, and latterly a boutique bakery, all within the Greater London area.
                This wealth of experience has provided the essential foundation for N7 Pastry,
                enabling Gemma to develop a true understanding of what quality dessert creation
                requires.
